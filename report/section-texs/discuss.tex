In this section, we discuss potential enhancements to our system design and evaluation.

\textbf{Improved Evaluation Method: Bypassing Processing System (PS).} Our evaluation results reveal that the limited performance of the ZCU102 PS hardware hampers a comprehensive exploration of our hardware design's potential. To obtain more accurate evaluation results, bypassing the PS section of the board could be a more viable option. Specifically, processed Ethernet packets could be redirected to another SFP interface after undergoing processing by our custom IPs in the PL logic, avoiding involvement with the underpowered ARM CPUs.

\textbf{Enhanced NAT Design for Performance and Resource Efficiency.} Linear probing requires fewer resources at the cost of wasting more cycles. We can harness hardware parallelism by introducing structures like a fully associative cache in our NAT table, promising one-cycle latency. Additionally, implementing a RAM matrix may further reduce interconnect consumption.

\textbf{Addressing Connection State Management.} A fully functional NAT should track connection states to release NAT table entries in a timely manner. Due to project time constraints, we discussed and proposed a possible design for this aspect but did not implement it.
